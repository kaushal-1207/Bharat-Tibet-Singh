            <h3>Tibet Support Groups Adopt Declaration to Recognise CTA as Legitimate Representative of Tibetans
              Worldwide.</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Delhi: The two-day conference of Pan India Tibet Support Groups held in Delhi concluded today with the
              adoption of many notable declarations pursuant to the Tibet Policy and Support Act 2020 passed by the US
              Congress. The declarations adopted today serve as a roadmap to induce clear policies on Tibet by the
              government of India. Read the declaration here.

              Some of the significant demands of the representatives include the Indian government’s recognition of the
              Central Tibetan Administration as the legitimate representative of Tibetans worldwide while ushering
              complete support of the Middle Way Approach of the CTA in resolving the enduring Sino-Tibet conflict. In
              addition, the delegates petitioned to denounce China’s intervention in the reincarnation of Tibetan tulkus
              and called for more political involvement or support to defend the national identity of the Tibetan
              people.

            <h3>Education in Tibet</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet. He was born on 6 July
              1935, to a farming family, in a small hamlet located in Taktser, Amdo, northeastern Tibet. At the age of
              two the child, who was named Lhamo Dhondup at that time was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th
              Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso. The Dalai Lamas are believed to be manifestations of Avalokiteshvara or
              Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion and patron saint of Tibet. Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings
              who have postponed their own nirvana and chosen to take rebirth in order to serve humanity.
            </p>
            <h3>Leadership Responsibilities</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              In 1950 His Holiness was called upon to assume full political power after China’s invasion of Tibet in
              1949. In 1954, he went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders, including
              Deng Xiaoping and Chou Enlai. But finally, in 1959, with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan national
              uprising in Lhasa by Chinese troops, His Holiness was forced to escape into exile. Since then he has been
              living in Dharamsala, northern India, the seat of the Tibetan political administration in exile. Since the
              Chinese invasion, His Holiness has appealed to the United Nations on the question of Tibet. The General
              Assembly adopted three resolutions on Tibet in 1959, 1961 and 1965.
